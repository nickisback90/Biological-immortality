🌟 Overview
The Quantum Biological Immortality Framework is a comprehensive Swift-based simulation of cutting-edge cellular rejuvenation technologies designed to achieve biological immortality by addressing the fundamental causes of aging at the cellular level.

"By preventing cells from reaching senescence, one can achieve biological immortality; telomeres, a 'cap' at the end of DNA, are thought to be the cause of cell aging. Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies."

💻 Quick Start
Basic Usage
swift
import QuantumImmortality

// Create a cellular immortality engine
let engine = CellularImmortalityEngine()
let protocolEngine = CellularImmortalityEngine.ImmortalityProtocol()

// Create a sample cell
var stemCell = CellularImmortalityEngine.Cell(type: .stemCell)

// Apply rejuvenation protocols
protocolEngine.executeTelomereMaintenance(cell: &stemCell)
protocolEngine.reverseSenescence(cell: &stemCell)
protocolEngine.rejuvenateMitochondria(cell: &stemCell)

// Check cell state
print("Telomere Length: \(stemCell.telomeres.first?.length ?? 0) bp")
